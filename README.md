# Machine Learning Mathematical Structures
We will try to apply the ideas behind the article "Machine-Learning Mathematical Structures" by Yang-Hui He. 
For this, we will try to implement a Machine learning algorithm for each of the problem proposed in section 3.
Each Jupyter Notebook will be a different problem.

Roots_with_Multiplicity: 
We attempt to classify quadratic polynomial on two classes depending on having one or two different roots. We use synthetic data
created with Numpy, and we build two models: A neural network and a Random Forest model. 
While the Neural Network is not able to classify the polynomials, the Random Forest Model excel incredibly achieving a 0.999~ accuracy.
